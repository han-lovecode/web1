    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</a> is the code that is used to structure a <u>web</u> page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

        HTML is not a programming language; it is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
